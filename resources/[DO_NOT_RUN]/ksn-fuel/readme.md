So this is a replacement for LegacyFuel with some added features.

- Fuel Types.. Run a higher octane to give you more HP but at the cost of reliability
- NOS pumps.. refill your nos tanks
- fuel trucks.. combined with ksn-trucklogistics, you can deliver fuel for an event or an organization (assuming you have the right certifications)
- player-owned gas stations with Tablet UI showing fuel level, set prices, fuel types, etc.
- Set up fuel deliveries from player-owned logistics companies
