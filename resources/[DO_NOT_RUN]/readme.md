 So, what the hell is all this? Well it's where I build modules in a folder that is not activated by the server.cfg but makes it easy to move them around for testing. I am also working on building some of these as complete stand-alones so you can just copy them into your resources folder and they will run entirely self-contained.. but I want to build a framework to keep the module size and shared dependency as small as possible for better performance in larger scale builds.
